* CAMEO Score aggregation
  We would like to aggregate the CAMEO scores of all data per some time unit into a single 
new one to give us our time series. The existing literature indentifies four ways to do that.
** Goldstein mean
** Goldstein sum
** Goldstein counts (positive and negative)
** Duvall and Thompson counts
